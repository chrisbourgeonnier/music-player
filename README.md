# Music Player
_A music player with simple functions and a playlist._  
This is another one of the FreeCodeCamp projects for the JavaScript path.
It was about **Audio**, essential string and array methods like the **find()**, **forEach()**,** map()**, and **join()**.  
Other stuff includes: Ternary, Math.random, .getElementById, .querySelectorAll, .classList.add/remove, .setAttribute, .removeAttribute, .addEventListener

Again, I thought it was worth uploading here, and I will try to make improvements to it when I have time. There could be something to do about the playlist, and the style.

"In this project, you'll code a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project covers fundamental concepts such as handling audio playback, managing a playlist, implementing play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle functionalities. You'll even learn how to dynamically update your user interface based on the current song."
